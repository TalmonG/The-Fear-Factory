    /*Don’t show me the monster! My brain and every player’s brain will create a much more terrifying horror than 
    your CGI ever can. But do assist that thing, give us sounds, shadows, shaking landscape - whatever you need 
    it to be. Play wingman, but let the mystery do the work.
    Avoid jump scares: As others have pointed out - they are so overdone and feel cheap.Sure, I’ll jump, or scream 
    or throw my controller but then I”m going to come back feeling cheated by you.Make the real jumping moments real.
    Give me downtime! I need to breath. I need my pulse to slow for a few moments so that when the next hit comes and 
    my heart pounds it’s a fresh injection of adrenaline. Most of us that play these games are chasing that rush.Ride it like a pro!
    Let me make the decisions for my character: Don’t rail road me all of the time. Let me make choices that have 
    consequences be they good or bad, or a combination - but let that choice be mine, not just because every door in 
    the hallway is locked.
    Change it once I’ve seen it! Nothing is creepier then turning back to my previous option to find it is missing, or 
    changed in some way… I could have sworn that door was on the right… not the left..?
    Don’t get caught up in micromanagement! Nothing destroys the moment so much as flipping through pages upon pages 
    of gear to find the right X, Y or Z for the situation. Keep me focussed on the story and the action, not 
    managing my inventory/tools etc.
    Minimize HUD: Let me live the moment.The more flashy objects on my screen, the less ‘real’ it feels, and the less 
    likely I am to truly get into the moment. Have a floating HUD that fades when unused, or better yet, minimalist 
    the crap out of that thing.
    Do something new! We all know the dimly lit halls, the thunderstorm, etc. Do something new - you can still pull 
    it all off but put it against a vibrant landscape - a cold dark cellar on a warm sunny day is creepy.Our brain 
    tells us we’re safe because the sun is out and monsters are of the night… right? .. prove that no time is safe :)
    Make me feel safe - then take it away! Give me a companion right after a terrifying sequence, or something 
    comforting.Make me feel for a little bit I’m no longer alone — and then, once I’ve become comfortable in my 
    company and trusting of it - take it away, you plunge us back into being alone, scared… this goes along with 
    riding the adrenaline.
    Give me something beautiful too: As I mentioned above, most horror games are so damn dark and depressing, I find 
    I just don’t want to be in that environment all the time.Give me something gorgeous to look at while scaring 
    the crap out of me. It will make me want to try again when I do fail…
    Make it global: Not every gamer is a twitch gamer, offer opportunities for those of us less likely to get the right 
    sequence in a short time the ability to win by making an easier version - remember many gamers have 
    limitations - visual or physical, but want to enjoy your story as much as the power gamers.Give tools 
    for them to do that!
    Make it count: Make consequences count.If I die, punish me for it.See that last post? Give some options for 
    those who are easily frustrated (Witcher 3 did a great job offering a face-roll version for those who want 
    to see the story without all the button mashing). But offer those who want the hardcore experience something 
    to really work for.*/
